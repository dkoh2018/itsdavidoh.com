are you kidding me? i never quit trading.

<!--
But a part of me kind of wanted a change. I've been trading almost everyday since the end of high school until i was 25. to put into perspective that's almost 30% of my life.

I loved what i did. I still remember the days when i would leave Fremd to go to HArperto access their desktops. I envy those who start now since the idea of paper trading softwares and free commission platforms like robinhood didn't exist until maybe a few years after i started.

youtube? fintwit? AI anaylsi?

forget about it

Since the grind was real, it was only a matter of time that I realized i had two options. 1) persevere or 2) get a mentor

since i was in high school, i dind't have a metnor so perseverer it was. But onto Northwetsern, i've met more people and when our'e a profitable trader at a very young age, you catch eyes. I've gotten to know 100's of people through my passion just by teaching and venturing with others and so did my knowledgei n the markets.

anyways back to the story... so why did i want a change?

well i did many things in college and after. i worked for 2 funds, i made my own fund, and i even had a clientelle of over 750 people all within the same job of trading/ivnesting. even though the markets grew, i wasn't sure if the people grew.

you see, part of the reason i wanted a change was not because of hte nature of the business but the nature of people. Passion was all around me in northwetsern but since covid, i had a difficult time seeing it within others. part of hte reaosn trading works the way it does is because it's systemaitcal but sometimes intuiton plays a lot into it. unforutnaely, we live in a misinformed culture where vierwerships matter more than actual knowledge of dynamic markets, resulting in poor qualtiy educaiton.

Dont' get me wrong, many are great traders but i think people are now motivated differently -->
