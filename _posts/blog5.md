# and legally too...

you know what they say: when you can't beat the system, use the system.

the trick, though, is that it requires some level of effort and money. every year, people pay $10,000+ in taxes and live day by day letting the system drain their hard-earned bread.

as a w2 employee, there aren't many ways to save on taxes:

- contribute to a 401(k)
- use an hsa
- harvest losses

but this barely gets your taxes down...

# we want $0

again, to use the system, you still need **some money and effort** but that doesn't mean [**succession money**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/)

personally, i believe in generating more income and worrying about taxes when the bag accumulates but that's another skillset.

# 1) get a rental property ("no kidding")

buying a rental property helps in strategically generating losses that offset w-2 income.

# 2) make your str active

usually, properties are classified as passive. but if the average stay is less than 7 days, the short-term-rental (str) isn't considered a rental activity (section 1.469-1t(e)(3)(ii))

# 3) material participation (irs pub. 925)

here's the effort portion. this means participation of:

for more than 500 hours, or
for 100 hours and at least as much as anyone else

# 4) run a cost segregation study (irs pub 5653)

commercial property can be depreciated over a 39-year straight line, while residential property can be depreciated over a 27.5-year straight line

a cost segregation study reclassifies some building costs into 5, 7, and 15-year property, speeding up depreciation.

here's a breakdown:

buy a rental for $350,000
typically, 80% is building and 20% land, so ~$280,000 can be depreciated
a cost segregation study might reclassify 20-40% of the building. let's just say 30% (~$84,000) into 5/15-year property
use bonus depreciation to expense that 5/15-year property immediately (irs pub 946)
bonus depreciation is 60% in 2024, leading to ~$52,000 in deductions
combine this with building depreciation, mortgage interest, or renovations, and it could mean a $55-$60,000 loss in year 1.

# use tax savings for another str

a $60,000 loss could save around $20,000 in taxes, depending on the tax bracket. this could help cover a chunk of the down payment for another rental.

---

when it's time to sell the rental, you'll be subject to depreciation recapture.

however, you can

use a like-kind exchange to defer the gains (irc section 1031), or
pass it to heirs for a step-up in basis

# again, for this to work...

you need to generate income by renting out to short-term rental websites like airbnb or anywhere that is good for stays under 7 days

...if you just plan on purchasing a property for tax savings, you WILL lose more money overall

_good luck, and have fun!_
