loved by developers. hated by new developers.

it's taken the world by storm and the pace of innovation just doesn't seem to end.

but wait... isn't it for the new developers? haven't you seen all the possibilities people with no code knowledge can make and build?

here's how my conversation went last week:

---

- **friend**: "bro, it's so over. i literally built this bookkeeping app. the ui isn't the greatest but i made this in an hour."

- **me**: "sure, can you send it to me?"

- **friend**: "localhost:3000/"

it's quite comedic to see the irony in his statement

stay cracked
