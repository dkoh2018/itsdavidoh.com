we spend the first 18+ years of our lives studying in school. everything is made systematically.

**"if you do this and that, then you "should" reap the benefits"**

however it doesn't seem to be the case. unless you've gotten a taste in entreprenuesrhip, many come to realize a bit too late that the materials they have studied or their degrees bear minimal value transitioning out of the academic world.

as a former white collar worker going back to school as a current masters student in computer science, i've come to quickly realize the university courses lack depth outside of academia. many of the platforms and materials are at least a decade behind and not as relevant for industry standards.

we can debate and shift the blame towards the univesrity but that's a futile debate.
