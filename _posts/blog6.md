title: "how to study as a developer"

we spend the first 18+ years of our lives studying in school. everything is made systematically.

**"if you do this and that, then you 'should' reap the benefits"**

however, it doesn't seem to be the case. unless you've gotten a taste of entrepreneurship, many come to realize a bit too late that the materials they have studied or their degrees bear minimal value when transitioning out of the academic world.

as a former white-collar worker going back to school as a current master's student in computer science, i've come to quickly realize that university courses lack depth outside of academia. many of the platforms and materials are at least a decade behind and not as relevant to industry standards.

we can debate and shift the blame towards the university, but that's a futile debate.

# the objective of coding

there are billions of paid and free courses online teaching you the latest react framework, the newest algorithm, how to crack your coding interviews, etc.

one could assume that the strength of the developer purely comes from the vast knowledge of tools within their vault.

it's true to a degree.

however, **coding is nothing more than translating business solutions and needs.**

**in my opinion, there are generally 2 ways to learn deeply**

the first way is best explained by colin. [watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm68uFy6gus)

the second way is growth through intuitive failures.

too scared to solve that hard leetcode problem? too scared to look at the documentation for node.js? are you frightened by the word AWS?
