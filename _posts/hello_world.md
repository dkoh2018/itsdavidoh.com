Well, I've finally done it. After years of lurking in forums and consuming endless content, I'm stepping out from behind the digital curtain. This blog? It's my new sandbox, my laboratory for ideas. As you can tell from my title, I'm not too sure what to talk about, but let me introduce myself at least.

I've spent nearly a decade dissecting the stock market's DNA. While the new wave of traders cut their teeth on commission-free apps, I remember when a single trade cost more than a decent dinner. Those experiences shaped my approach, honed my instincts.

In fact, let me just tell you what I've seen to this date and have played as well:

- Biotech Boom
- Chinese Housing Market Pop
- Oil Price Crash
- Trump Tariff Wars
- XIV Implosion
- COVID-19 Market Crash
- Crypto Boom and Bust Cycles
- Federal Reserve Policies
- Brexit Referendum
- FAANG Stocks Surge
- GameStop Short Squeeze
- SPAC Boom

Having graduated from Northwestern University in 2018, I've since fully immersed myself into the world of trading. The endless hours staring at screens, day and night, including weekends, exacted a hefty toll on my body. In a twist of fate fueled by cockiness and an insatiable appetite for adventure, I found myself nursing a motorcycle injury in 2019. As if that wasn't enough, I've also undergone calcification treatment with electro-shockwave therapy on my left shoulder. Fun times, indeed.

But here's the thing: I'm not just here to reminisce. As I watched my body rebel against those grueling hours, I had an epiphany - tech was the solution to my needs. Scalability. That's the golden ticket. The allure of high-level mathematics combined with scalability and automated systems drew me in. Do the dirty work early, and reap the rewards later, right?

As of this writing, I'm pursuing a master's degree in computer science at DePaul University. I plan to use this digital space as a crucible for pushing my boundaries and challenging my long-held assumptions. Sure, I could stick to what I know â€“ numbers, probabilities, market patterns. But where's the thrill in playing it safe?

Expect the unexpected. One day I might be dissecting market trends, the next I could be exploring the philosophical implications of AI in finance, or perhaps guiding you through the latest paradigms in coding. It's all fair game.
