# life's like a video game, but better

imagine you're diving into gta or any kick-ass rpg — life's not about just hanging in there, visiting the same old spots, or chilling at home. nah, you start from scratch. picture this:

- your first gig, a small-time heist
- you're pretty much bare-handed
- no firepower
- not a dime to your name

and pulling off a big score? forget about it. you gotta build up your:

1. arsenal
2. cash flow
3. ride-or-die buddies you can actually rely on

> "so do you want me to go hijack a car or plan a heist like in gta?"

no idiot. that'd be bonkers. but starting small is key.

# the grind

- zero in the bank? snag a job, flip something for a buck.
- dreaming of hitting that hundred? pump the brakes—you gotta earn that first dollar without any shortcuts.
- no cheat codes in life, my friend. it's all about that grind and the love of the game.

# deal-breaker

what's got you stuck? **embarrassment and shame**. you've boxed yourself into being "that person," scared stiff of changing because, what, you're worried about a few side-eyes?

**time to toss that crap aside and get in the game.**
