          i'm david oh. i started trading in 2013, capitalizing on
          the biotech boom and later the volatile markets during
          covid-19, focusing on es futures and fang options. since

          fast forward to 2024, tech dominates the landscape and
          that's where this new journey begins. gone with the old, on
          with the new. my goal moving forward? to build solutions
          that are dangerously efficient and genuinely impactful.
          scalability and autonomy. i'm driven by the belief that
          many will fall behind in this tech revolution, and i'm
          determined not to let that happenâ€”not to me, not to you.

          i'm excited to take you along on this journey. whether it's
